        <div id="instructions">Hello! Welcome to my first game. This is a fully text-based game, meaning you will have to rely completely on your imagination to see everything.</div>
        <div>I would like to make this more complicated, but this first game will be very simple, all you need to do is find three items for me. After you finish reading these instructions, you will look through some words (imagining they are items) and find <span class="big">3</span> <span class="yellow">yellow</span> items for me. But be careful, not all of the items are just right, some of them might not be the right size, or the right shade-or maybe there's something else wrong with them...</div>
        <div>Are you ready?</div>
